# 3rd project from CS 4253-01
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

Taught by [Dr. Sandip Sen](https://engineering.utulsa.edu/computer-science/faculty/profile/sandip-sen/) at the University of Tulsa in SP 23.

This repository implements the following decision techniques to play a discretized soccer game:
 - Minimax game tree search.
 - Minimax game tree search with $\alpha$ - $\beta$ pruning.
 - Monte Carlo game tree search.

The goal of this project was to compare the advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms with the soccer game domain.

This repository is a fork of a discretized soccer game written by the TU MASTERS group. [[1]](https://github.com/TUmasters/cs4253).
